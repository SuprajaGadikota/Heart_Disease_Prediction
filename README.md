# Heart_Disease_Prediction

This is a Machine learning model, which is used to predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not. I created a prediction model using Logistic Regression model.  

Work flow:
1. Data  is preprocessed into Train Test split 
2. Feed training data to our machine learning algorithm i.e., Logistic Regressing model
3. Evaluate the model we get Trained Logistic Regression model
4. Give new data to the trained model to predict our required output

Technologies used: Python
